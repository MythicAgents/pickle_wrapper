# Pickle Injection Wrapper
The `pickle_wrapper` payload is a special payload. This is a python encoder that acts as a "wrapper" around a Medusa agent (any python agent should work). As such, this payload type has no commands and no supported C2 profiles - it simply acts as a way to turn arbitrary other agents into pickle op codes and injects that into a specified Pickle.

## Setup

## How to install an agent in this format within Mythic

In order to install the agent, it's pretty simple. Within Mythic you can run the `mythic-cli` binary to install this in one of three ways:

* `./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/pickle_wrapper` to install the main branch
* `./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/pickle_wrapper branchname` to install a specific branch of that repo
* `./mythic-cli install folder /path/to/local/folder/cloned/from/github` to install from an already cloned down version of an agent repo

## Updates to get things working
Medusa needs to be updated to support pickle_wrapper.

if you get `RECONDITION_FAILED - message size XXXXXXX is larger than configured max size 134217728"`
edit Mythic/rabbitmq-docker/rabbitmq.conf to add the following line
`max_message_size = 536870911`
This is caused when injecting an agent into a pickled file that is larger than approximately 100MB. This sets the maximum to it's complete maximum, and will still only handle 500MB, so another solution is being sought out.

## Development
If you are testing on Windows and need to start the http listenner
1. After starting mythic edit `docker-compose.yml`
 - Under the HTTP service delete `network_mode: host` and `extra_hosts:` as well as the two lines start with `-` after `extra_hosts:`
 - Add
 ```
  networks:
    - default_network
```
2. Run `sudo ./mythic-cli mythic start http`
